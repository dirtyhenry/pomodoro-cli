# üçÖ Pomodoro CLI

Pomodoro is a [Swift](https://swift.org) command line tool to help you implement the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) from your terminal.

When I started this project, I wrote a [blog post][blog-post] on my motivations on [bootstragram.com][bootstragram].

## Installation

First, make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) & [Swift](https://swift.org/getting-started/) are installed on your environment.

Then:

```bash
make install
make deploy
```

## Usage

`pomodoro-cli` only supports one argument: the duration of your pomodoro timer in seconds. For instance, if you stick to the pomodoro book, you should use `1500` (25 minutes √ó 60 seconds = 1,500 seconds).
